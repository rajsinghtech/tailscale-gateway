# Welcome to Tailscale Gateway Docs

Tailscale Gateway is a Kubernetes operator that provisions and manages **Tailscale Exit Nodes** to expose cluster services and resources to your private Tailscale network.

These docs will help you:

1. Install the operator
2. Understand its CRDs and controller behaviour
3. Deploy example gateways
4. Troubleshoot common issues

## Why use Tailscale Gateway?

* 🛡️ **Zero-trust networking** – expose services securely without opening inbound firewall ports.
* ⚡ **Developer friendly** – connect to clusters from laptops without VPNs.
* 🚀 **Easy self-service** – create gateways with standard Kubernetes manifests.
